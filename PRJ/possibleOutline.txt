Possible outline- Thoughts?

I. Introduction and Motivation for SymPy

II. Core Features and Usage in SymPy
	- Brief outline of core features and description of current modules
		- Symbolic computation
		- Handful of obviously useful modules (matrices, integration, differentiation, stats, whatever)
		- Pretty printing and plotting
	 
	- Interesting Python features used in SymPy implementation (could be integrated in above sections)

Here is what I propose for II:
	- Symbolic Computation
		- Features and Usage
		- Implementation
	- Printing and Plotting
		- Features and Usage
		- Output Formats Supported
		- Implementation
End proposal

III. SymPy in Real World Applications
	- Who is using SymPy for interesting projects?
	(I feel like Matloff would love to hear about real-world usage of the library.)
