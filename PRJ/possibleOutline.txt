Possible outline- Thoughts?


I. Intro/Motivation for SymPy

II. SymPy Overview/Tutorial
	- Brief outline of core features and description of current modules
		- Symbolic computation
		- Handful of obviously useful modules (matrices, integration, differentiation, stats, whatever)
		- Pretty printing and plotting
		 
	- Interesting Python features used in SymPy implementation

III. SymPy Applications
	- Who is using SymPy for interesting projects? I feel like Matloff would love to hear about real-world usage of the library
